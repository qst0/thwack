# 10 Find a pattern

Much of what we call “intelligence” is our ability to recognize patterns.

Imagine that you’re watching television with some friends. Someone walks into the room, trips over a chair and knocks it down. What’s your impression of this person? That he’s a klutz, right?

Five minutes later, another person walks in, and she too knocks over the chair. Ten minutes later, the whole scene is repeated. What’s your opinion now? Probably that the chair is in the wrong place and should be moved. Nice going, you’ve recognized a pattern!

As the old adage goes: Once is an instance, twice may be a coincidence, but three or more times make a pattern.

We find patterns all around us:

* We see similarities: stellar galaxies and water emptying out of a bathtub both spiral in the same way.

* We calculate probabili-ties: the more graffiti on the back of a road sign, the more difficult it will be to hitch-hike a ride from that spot.

* We observe tendencies: terminally ill nursing-home patients are more likely to die after a holiday than before.

* We make connections: neighboring stars in the night sky form the outline of a lion (the constellation Leo).

* We recognize self-fulfilling prophesies: people who delight in synchronicity find meaningful coincidences almost everywhere.

* We see relationships: the tighter a government’s restrictions on its press, the less prosperous that society’s economy is likely to be.

* We figure out sequences: Fibonacci numbers consist of adding together the two previous numbers to create the current one: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 and so on.

* We arrive at correlations: on the whole, bigger animals such as whales, elephants, and humans live longer than smaller animals such as mice, hummingbirds, and snakes.

* We discern behaviors: people in crowded elevators tend to look at the ceiling.

* We discover laws: the force of any object — say a two-ton boulder rolling down a mountainside into the side of a wooden barn — equals its mass times its acceleration.

* We detect flows: money moves away from weakness and toward strength and opportunity.

* And, we discover personal inclinations: when I'm hungry or tired, I’m more likely to get irritated.

### How do we find patterns?

Often they just pop into our heads. But we can also find them by getting into a pattern-seeking frame of mind. First we notice something that has occurred one or more times. Then we focus our thinking and look for or remember other things related to it.

As the ancient Philosopher Heraclitus put it: “The cosmos speaks to us in patterns.”  Our job is to “listen” for them.


* What patterns do you see in your situation?

* What rhythms describe its “flow”?
