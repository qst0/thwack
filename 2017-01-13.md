# 5 Look for the second right answer

Philosopher Emilé Chartier:

“Nothing is more dangerous than an idea when it’s the only one you have.”

Don’t stop with the first right answer you find. Dig deeper and look for others.

This is why professional photographers take so many pictures when shooting an important subject. They may take twenty, sixty, or a hundred shots. They’ll change the exposure, the lighting, the filters, and so on. That’s because they know that out of all the pictures they take, there may be only a few that capture what they’re looking for.

It’s the same way with creative thinking: you need to generate a lot of ideas in order get a few good ones.

Indeed, when you look for more than one right answer, you allow your imagination to open up.

For example: how do you keep a fish from smelling? Cook it as soon as you catch it. Freeze it. Wrap it in paper. Leave it in the water. Switch to chicken. Keep a cat around. Burn incense. Cut its nose off.

Looking for the second right answer is especially important when you’re dealing with ambiguous situations and messages.

For example: in 546 BC, Croesus, the last ruler of the Lydian Empire, consulted the Delphic Oracle for ideas on how to deal with the Persians. He received the following prophecy:

“If you attack, a great empire will be destroyed.”

Croesus took this as an encouraging sign, and led his army against the Persians fully expecting to destroy their empire. Instead, he was soundly defeated, and it was his empire that was lost.

Croesus should have looked for the second right answer!

— What’s the second right answer in your situation?

— What good ideas are just below the surface?
— What aren’t you seeing?
Tip: Ask questions that solicit plural answers.

When confronted with a problem, people often ask: “What’s the answer?” or “What’s the result?” as though there were only one. If we ask questions that solicit plural answers such as, “What are the meanings?” or “What are the results?” you will find that people will think a little more deeply and offer more than one idea.

Tip: Give yourself a tight constraint.

Strict limits stimulate us to look for more right answers. If you’ve ever been asked to solve a challenging problem with a small budget or a tight deadline, you’ve probably found that you were more resourceful than had you been granted a ton of money and time.

As architect Frank Lloyd Wright told his students, “Limits are an artist’s best friend.”

That’s because they force us to think beyond conventional solutions and find answers we might not have otherwise discovered.

For example, skyscrapers weren’t created by people with cheap, unlimited land, but by innovators who wrestled with the problem,

“How do we create abundant office space on small pieces of expensive real estate?”

— What constraints can you add to your problem? What new solutions now become apparent?
