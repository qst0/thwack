# 69 Use Your Forgettery

“Knowing many things doesn’t teach insight.”

A creativity teacher invited a student to his house for tea. They talked for a while, and then it was teatime.
The teacher poured some tea into the student’s cup.
Even after the cup was full, he continued to pour, and soon tea flowed onto the floor.

“Stop pouring; the tea isn’t going into the cup.”

The teacher replied,

"The same is true with you. If you are to receive any of my teachings, you must first empty out your mental cup.”

His point: without the ability to forget, our minds remain cluttered up with ready-made assumptions, and we’re not motivated to ask the questions that lead our own thinking to new ideas.

As the novelist Henry Miller put it:

“My *forgettery* has been just as important to my success as my memory.”

Indeed, forgetting what we know, at the appropriate time, can be an important means for gaining insight.

Here’s an example:

A seminar exercise I like to do involves making paper airplanes.
I assign the participants to different teams and give each team fifty sheets of paper.

Then I draw a line at the back of the room.
Each team has five minutes to see how many airplanes it can make that can fly past the line,
and the one with the most is the winner.

The most common approach is to fold the sheets into conventional paper airplane shapes.

But the winning design, more often than not, is a sheet of paper that has been crumpled into a ball.
The crumpled balls of paper invariably “fly” past the line, the only criterion that has to be satisfied in the exercise.

And the losing teams immediately grasp that what had most hobbled their thinking were their assumptions about what a paper airplane is supposed to look like.

The winning teams also had these same assumptions initially, but then conveniently forgot them.

* What conventional wisdom are you relying on?
* What would happen if you forgot the obvious answers that spring to mind and searched for new ones?
* What assumptions can you let go of?
