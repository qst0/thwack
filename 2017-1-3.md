68 Stir things up

“The barley-wine drink falls apart unless it is stirred.”

In ancient Greece, the “barley-wine” drink (kukeon) was a sacred libation made by mixing together ground barley, grated cheese, and wine. If the drink were not kept in a state of constant agitation, the contents stratified and the barley-wine drink ceased to exist.

Our minds are like this. If we settle into comfortable routines, our thinking becomes stagnant and rigid. We need a challenge — such as solving a problem, pursuing an opportunity, having something at risk, or dealing with something new — to bring vitality to our minds.

Tip: Appreciate the creative power of turbulence.

Turbulence can be destructive — turbulent water can capsize ships and rupture pipes.

Turbulence can also be beneficial. It creates the dynamic mixing of materials that are typically separated when at rest.

This is good for the creative process: ideas get stirred together that might not otherwise be joined. As historian Chester Starr put it:

“Every so often civilization works itself into a corner from which further progress is virtually impossible along the lines then apparent.

“If new ideas are to have a chance, the old systems must be so turbulently shaken that they lose their dominance.”

Genghis Khan’s Mongol invasion of China in the thirteenth century shook up what had become a stagnant country. The ensuing mixture of Mongol military tactics and expert horsemanship with Chinese iron technology and administrative know-how led to political unity, a flourishing commercial sector, and expanded trade routes.

— Think back to a particularly turbulent part of your own life. What new things came together for you as a result?
— How can you stir things up in your issue?
— What can you question, challenge, and eliminate?
