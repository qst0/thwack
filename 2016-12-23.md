35 Reframe the Situation

We impose out own order on the world through the concepts and categories of our language. If we change the words we use to describe a situation, we reframe the way we think about it. For example: is the beach the end of the ocean or the beginning of land? Is a twelve-year-old female an old child or a young woman? Is the cocoon the end of the caterpillar or the beginning of the butterfly? Is water the end of ice or the beginning of vapor (or vice versa)? You could answer "Yes" to any of these questions. This shows that a thing, idea, or issue can be understood in a bariety of different ways depending on how it is framed.

* What other words and concepts can you use to describe your situation? What action did you take today that marked the end of one era and the beginning of a new one?

36 Spot the Opportunity

A leading business school did a study which showed that its graduates succeeded initially, but after ten yers were overtaken by a more street-wise group. The reason, according to the professor who ran the study: "We taught the how to solve problems, not recognize opportunities." What's the difference between these two activites? The problem solver focuses on fixing what's broken, or making something whole again. The opportunity seeker goes further, asking, "How can I take advantage of the ambiguity in this situation by trying something new? Where might that lead? What do I see that I wasn't paying attention to before?" Invertor Alexander Graham Bell must have been thinking along thses lines when he said, "When one door closes, another opens; but oftern we look so long upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us."

* Think of a current problem. Rather than just fixing it, ask yourself, "What special opportunities does it hold?"
