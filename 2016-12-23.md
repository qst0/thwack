74 Change Contexts "On a circle, an end point can also be a beginning point." -Heraclitus

An idea or thing takes its meaning from the context in which you put it.
If you change its context, it will take on a different meaning.

For example, if you say, "Make me one with everything" to a teacher of religious mysticism, it signifies one thing, but to a hot-dog venter it means something quite different.

Similarly, if an amusement park operator tells a middle-aged man, "I'll bring out the kid in you," one set of expectations will be created; but if an obstetrician says this to a woman in labor, a different result will occur.

Thus, changing context is a good way to discover the possibilities of your resources.

A classic example of someone who did this is the 15th century German inventor Johannes Gutenberg. Gutenberg combined two previously unconnected ideas: the wine press and the coin punch.

The Purpose of the coin punch was to leave an image on a small area such as a gold coin. The function of the wine press was, and still is, to apply force over a large area to squeeze out the juice of grapes. One day, Gutenberg, perhaps after he'd drunk a goblet or two of wine, asked himself:
  "What if I took a bunch of these coin punches and put them under the force of the winepress so that they left their image on paper?"
The resulting combination was the print press and moveable type.

Another Example is the artist Pablo Picasso. One day he went outside his house and found an old bicycle. He looked at it for a little bit, and removed the seat and then the handle bars. Then he welded them together to create the head of a bull.

By simply playing with the context in which we think about things, we can transform one thing into another.

The Nobel prize winning physician Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi put it well when he said:

"Discovery consists of looking at the same thing as everyone else, and thinking something different."

* How can you reframe a current issue?
* In what other contexts can you put your resources?

35 Reframe the Situation

We impose out own order on the world through the concepts and categories of our language. If we change the words we use to describe a situation, we reframe the way we think about it. For example: is the beach the end of the ocean or the beginning of land? Is a twelve-year-old female an old child or a young woman? Is the cocoon the end of the caterpillar or the beginning of the butterfly? Is water the end of ice or the beginning of vapor (or vice versa)? You could answer "Yes" to any of these questions. This shows that a thing, idea, or issue can be understood in a bariety of different ways depending on how it is framed.

* What other words and concepts can you use to describe your situation? What action did you take today that marked the end of one era and the beginning of a new one?

36 Spot the Opportunity

A leading business school did a study which showed that its graduates succeeded initially, but after ten yers were overtaken by a more street-wise group. The reason, according to the professor who ran the study: "We taught the how to solve problems, not recognize opportunities." What's the difference between these two activites? The problem solver focuses on fixing what's broken, or making something whole again. The opportunity seeker goes further, asking, "How can I take advantage of the ambiguity in this situation by trying something new? Where might that lead? What do I see that I wasn't paying attention to before?" Invertor Alexander Graham Bell must have been thinking along thses lines when he said, "When one door closes, another opens; but oftern we look so long upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us."

* Think of a current problem. Rather than just fixing it, ask yourself, "What special opportunities does it hold?"
