14 Look to the past

History is loaded with lessons that we can apply to current situations.

Napoleon marching on Moscow is really just project management.

Mao waging a guerrilla war is like launching an advertising campaign.

Genghis Khan’s rapid creation of the far-flung Mongol Empire shows the power of ruthless discipline combined with innovative tactics.

Closed societies like Ming China highlight the dangers of getting closed off from potential growth areas.

The ill-fated Athenian invasion of Sicily during the Peloponnesian War demonstrates the pitfalls of having an able force led by an inflexible, weak leadership unwilling to change strategy when conditions change.

— What ideas from history can you apply to a current project?

— Pick a culture from the past, perhaps one that underwent revolutionary change. How would someone from that time deal with your issue?
— How about a culture whose beliefs are very different from yours?
— How about from your own personal history?
• What were you doing ten years ago that might be useful to you now?

• Last spring?

• The year you had your first big love?

• The happiest day of your life?

• The year of your greatest setback?

• The year you learned that life wasn’t all fun and games?

Tip: Look for patterns in history that you can apply to your situation.

For example, fractal geometrician Benoit Mandelbrot studied the historical data of some of the world’s great rivers, in particular the Nile, to ascertain the underlying patterns in how things change.

He characterized the patterns he saw by borrowing from stories from Genesis: the “Joseph Effect” and the “Noah Effect.”

The “Joseph Effect” — named after Joseph’s interpretation of Pharaoh’s dream of seven fat cows and seven gaunt ones to mean that there would be seven prosperous years followed by seven lean ones — describes persistence.

He discovered that trends tend to persist; that is, if a place has been suffering drought, it’s likely it will suffer more of the same. In other words, things tend to stay the way they’ve been recently. Some examples:

• Healthy people tend to stay healthy;

• Winning teams tend to keep on winning; and,

• Products that have been successful for the past five years will probably be successful next month.

On the other hand, the “Noah Effect” — named after the story of the Great Flood — describes discontinuity. Mandelbrot found that when something changes, it can change abruptly.

• A stable mountain of snow can suddenly unleash an avalanche.

• A stock priced at $40 a share can quickly fall to $5 without ever being priced at $30 or $20, if something significant triggers its collapse.

The Noah and Joseph Effects show that trends are real, but they can vanish as quickly as they come.

Thus, history shows us that we can expect what’s been happening to continue to happen, but we should also expect the unexpected.
