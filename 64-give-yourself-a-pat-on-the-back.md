# 64 Give yourself a pat on the back

What have you done well lately?

Where have you made progress?

What good things have you accomplished?

What obstacles have you overcome?

Congratulations!

Give yourself a pat on the back.

As the Indian philosopher Anish Chatterjee put it

“You’re not done with the project until you’re done celebrating.”

When you’re finished, go out and earn another one.

* What reward can you give yourself after you are successful with your issue?
* What rewards can you give to those who have helped you?
