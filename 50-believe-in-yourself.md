# 50 Believe in Yourself

The philosopher Epictetus remarked:

> "What concerns me is not the way things are, but rather the way people think things are."

Serveral years ago, a major oil company was concerned about the lack of creative productivity among its engineers. To deal with this problem, a team of psychologists were brought in to find out what differentiated the cretive people from the less creative ones.

The psychologists asked the engineers many questions ranging from where they grew up to their educational backgrounds were to what their favorite colors were.

The psychologists found that the cheif differentiating factor that separated the two groups was: the creative people thought they were creative, and the less creative people didn't think they were.

as a consequence, the creative people put themselves in a position where they could use their creativity: they allowed themselves to get into an imaginative frame of mind, play with their knowledge, take a few risks, and look for lots of right answers.

If you think you’re creative, you’ll act that way — and if you don’t, you won’t. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy: As you think, so you are.

### In what ways are you creative?

### What strengths do you have that you can apply to your issue?

The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus said:

> “I searched into myself.”

A good exercise is to take some time to figure out your own creative style, that is, what your own creative tendencies are.

Here are ten of mine:

1. I get my ideas either when I’m under a lot of pressure — “the ultimate inspiration is the deadline” — or when I’m away from the problem altogether. I rarely get them when I’m doing routine tasks that require some attention.

2. I try to pay attention to small things: how much frowning takes place in beer commercials, what sorts of patterns dead leaves make around a storm drain, and so on. I do this partly because I’ve trained myself to do it, but also because I’ve been forced to. I’m left-handed, but the world is designed for right-handed people — something most “righties” don’t even think about. I’m constantly being made conscious of how things are put together. For example, a lot of appliances are designed to make right-handed people feel comfortable and at ease, but lefties can sometimes feel clumsy using them.

3. If I’m mentally blocked in trying to solve a problem, it’s usually because I’m in love with a particular idea — so much so that it prevents me from looking for alternatives. Only when I force myself to become detached from it and “kiss it goodbye” do I find new answers. Letting go of a previously cherished idea can be one of life’s great pleasures.

4. My own ego can prevent me from discovering new things. However, if I allow myself to lower my resistance to those ideas that I typically dismiss as irrelevant or unattractive, I find that they can become doorways to solutions I’ve been overlooking.

5. I don’t know what I don’t know. I’ve got a big blind spot, and the only way to get access to what’s lurking out there is to put myself in a humble, receptive frame of mind (not always easy to do) and ask others to point out what I’m not seeing.

6. A dose of ambiguity stimulates my imagination. When I’m confused about a situation, I’m more likely to consider unusual options and explanations that just might help me solve my problem. Confusion is disorienting, but I also know that it’s a sign I’m making progress.

7. I love metaphors! Their imagery lights up my mind. If given the choice between an in-depth analysis of a situation or a vivid metaphor for the same, I’ll usually opt for the latter. Indeed, some of my best ideas have started out as metaphors.

8. I like “playing the fool” as a means of stirring up my own and others’ thinking. I don’t mind making an “out of left field” comment to see what reaction it generates. Or asking the stupid question that nobody else seems to be asking.

9. Rejection of my work in the early phases of the creative process doesn’t bother me. I’m not afraid of taking one of my less than stellar ideas and asking complete strangers what they think of it. I find their responses frank and refreshing.

10. I look for inspiration in many different areas, but above all, I look for it in myself. I’ve found that a sense of myself has been vital to my success as a creative person. But I’ve also found that when my feelings of self-worth get carried to extremes, my judgment gets clouded, and I risk cutting myself off from that deep ocean of being that sustains me — and us all.
