Every walking animal is driven to its purpose with a whack.
To avoid trying new things, some people develop attitudes that keep them safely stuck where they are.
These attitudes are:
* "It's not important."
* "I don't have time."
* "I already have the answer." 
They're dangerous because they lead to stagnation.
Thus, we like Heraclitus walking animals sometimes need a good whack to get us off our rear ends to make things happen.
I find that the following three questions can help spur people to action.
Try asking them to yourself, and give yourself an honest answer to each of them:
Am I getting lazy?
Am I becoming arrogant?
Am I getting timid
If the answer is yes to any one of them, that's a warning to kick that attitude.
For example, if you think you're being lazy, then set a tight deadline for yourself to accompish some specific objective.
If you're being arrogant, then imagine what you'd do if the situation you're feeling so smug about ceased to exist.
And, if you're timid, then take a risk and put yourself in a situation that will give you a better sense of who you are.

What tight deadline can you give yourself?
Which parts of your situation are you feeling a little too smug about?
What risks can you take?
