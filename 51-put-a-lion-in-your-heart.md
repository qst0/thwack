A well-known bullfighter:

“To fight a bull when you are not scared is nothing. And not to fight a bull when you are scared is nothing. But to fight a bull when you are scared — that is something.”

A new idea is different by nature — it’s off the beaten path — and it takes courage to risk failure or rejection.

How do you know that your brilliant insight isn’t going to lead you into a blind alley, make you look stupid, cost you money, or worse?

You don’t!

Thus, a crucial element of creative thinking is having the courage to take a risk.

As the philosopher Aristotle put it:

“Courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees the others.”

What are your sources of courage?

• Past success?

• Big potential payoff?

• Faith in the idea?

• Encouragement from others?

• Having a “Plan B”?

• Having no alternatives?

• Belief in yourself?

— What puts a lion in your heart?

— What helps you fight through your doubts?
— What’s the last courageous thing you’ve done?
