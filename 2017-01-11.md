# 80 Expect a surprise

“The sun is new each day.”

Life continually surprises us. Problems spring up in places that were trouble-free only just yesterday.

Opportunities suddenly arise in long stagnant arenas.

Routines that yielded predictable results stop working.

Heraclitus reminds us that nothing is permanent and we shouldn’t be slaves to our assumptions.

Instead we should attempt to keep our minds open about what is possible.

Indeed, we should strive to make room in our thinking for the unexpected. As the noted science fiction write Ursula LeGuin put it,

“It is the unexpected that makes life possible.”

How has life surprised you lately?

— What changes in your current situation would really surprise you?
— What problems might arise?
— What issue do you need to rethink? Is the idea you reacted against yesterday really so bad?
— Does the idea you fell in love with last week still shine?
