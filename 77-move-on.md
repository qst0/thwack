Heraclitus: “A thing rests by changing.”

This paradox poses the counter-intuitive notion that change is more restful than staying still.
It is resolved by understanding that it often takes less energyto move on to the next phase of a process
than to fight to stay in the current one.

It’s like rowing a boat on a river:
it requires more effort to resist the current and remain stationary than to go with the flow.

Similarly, I find that if I allow myself to let go of a cherished position, strategy, or belief
— especially one that takes increasingly more effort to hold on to — I am more easily able to find new alternatives.

— Where would you energy be better focused — on where you've been or on where you’re going?
— Is it time for you to move on to the next phase?

TIP: See the paradox of your situation.

In the midst of a difficult problem, the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr said, “How wonderful that we’ve met with a paradox. Now we have hope of making some progress.”

Bohr knew that paradoxes are crucial to the creative process. That’s because they “whack” us out of narrow thought paths and force us to question our assumptions.

Indeed, the very act of “seeing the paradox” is at the crux of creative thinking — the ability to entertain two different, often contradictory, notions at the same time.

Listed below are some of my favorite paradoxes. Some are humorous, some are off-beat, and some are profound. All, however, make us think — they give us a nice “creative whack.”

As you read these, you might ask yourself, “What’s paradoxical about my life or work? Is there another context that explains this contradiction?”

Pablo Picasso: “Art is a lie that makes us realize the truth.”

Montaigne: “A man who fears suffering is already suffering from what he fears.”

Voltaire: “The superfluous is a very necessary thing.”

Orville Mars: “The little I know I owe to my ignorance.”

Samuel Butler: “There is nothing so unthinkable as thought unless it be the entire absence of thought.”

Alan Kay: “Any company large enough to have a research lab is too large to listen to it.”

Katherine Mansfield: “If you wish to live, you must first attend your own funeral.”

N.F. Simpson: “We can’t leave the haphazard to chance.”

Confucius: “Real knowledge is knowing the extent of one’s ignorance.”

Niels Bohr: “There are two kinds of truth, small truth and great truth. You can recognize a small truth because its opposite is a falsehood. The opposite of a great truth is another great truth.”

Benjamin Disraeli: “No government can be long secure without formidable opposition.”

Ionesco: “Only the ephemeral is of lasting value.”

Ludwig Wittgenstein: “When I came home I expected a surprise and there was no surprise for me, so, of course, I was surprised.”

Lao-tzu: “Failure is the foundation of success, and success the lurking place of failure.”

— What is paradoxical in your current situation?
— How easily are you able to let go of one viewpoint in order to see a different one?
