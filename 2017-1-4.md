53 Flex your risk muscle.

Bull’s-eye every time? If so, you’re standing too close to the target.

If you’re not failing every now and again, it’s a sign you’re not doing anything very innovative.

Differentiate between errors of commission and errors of omission. The latter can be more costly than the former. If you’re not making many errors, you might ask yourself,“How many opportunities am I missing by not being more aggressive?”
Everyone has a risk muscle. You keep it in shape by trying new things. If you don’t, it atrophies and you’re no longer able to take chances.

• Try a new recipe.

• Invest in a new idea.

• Tackle a problem outside your field of expertise.

• Propose an idea to your boss.

• Let a subordinate take on one of your tasks.

As Arthur Koestler put it:

“If the Creator had a purpose in equipping us with a neck, he certainly would have meant for us to stick it out.”
