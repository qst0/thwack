# Thought Thwack

Thought Thwack is inspired by the amazing http://creativethink.com/ Creative and Innovative Whack Packs.
I want to create my own, based on some of the same insights of heraclitus and more.
The stories and creative strategies in the cards are above all fun and intresting. Please consider buying them!

Starting by reading and re-typing the daily Creative Whack Pack card on the creative think website:

74 Change Contexts -- "On a circle, an end point can also be a beginning point." -Heraclitus
