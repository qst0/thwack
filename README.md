# Thought Thwack

Thought Thwack is inspired by the amazing [Creative and Innovative Whack Packs](http://creativethink.com/).
The stories and creative strategies in the cards are fun and intresting. [Please consider buying them!](http://creativewhack.com/home.php?cat=3)

I want to create my own, based on some of the same insights of Heraclitus and other sources such as [The Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies).

I love the continued dialog that Roger Von Oech's cards bring to each situation and musing.
You can eaisly find something you agree with, or even better, something that will make you think.

The cards also encourage us each to do this ourselves.

I have located 'the heart of the cards' so to speak content / web wise [here.](http://creativethink.com/WhackPack/LiveCards/01.html)

I am still organizing and basicaly stiring the cards in their new form.

## My Goal: <br> Collect the musings within the cards for elaboration

I did this manually for a few weeks, then took a peek at the source pages.

I used `curl` on the page url for the whack of the day and gained even more info.

Each page as a coded url is listed on [this page.](all_whacks.md)

> "Every walking animal is driven to its purpose with a whack." -Heraclitus

### Then What?

I will be adding my own "Thwack" to concept and ideas brought to the table.

Putting a yo-yo and programming *spin* on things.

### How did this all happen?

Out shopping at a resale store looking to buy games,

I ended up with the Creative Whack Pack, missing a few cards, in my hand for 88 cents.

I was captivated and soon found [creativethink.com](http://creativethink.com/)

#### Wait, who made the cards?
