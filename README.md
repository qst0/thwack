# Thought Thwack

Thought Thwack is inspired by the amazing [Creative and Innovative Whack Packs](http://creativethink.com/).
The stories and creative strategies in the cards are fun and intresting. Please consider buying them!

I want to create my own, based on some of the same insights of heraclitus and other sources.

## My Goal: <br> Collect the musings within the cards for elaboration

["On a circle, an end point can also be a beginning point." -Heraclitus](2016-12-23.md)

### Then What?

I will be adding my own "Thwack" to concept and ideas brought to the table.

Putting a yo-yo and programming *spin* on things.
