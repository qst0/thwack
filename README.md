# Thought Thwack

Thought Thwack is inspired by the amazing [Creative and Innovative Whack Packs](http://creativethink.com/).
The stories and creative strategies in the cards are fun and intresting. Please consider buying them!

I want to create my own, based on some of the same insights of heraclitus and other sources.

I have located 'the heart of the cards' so to speak content / web wise [here.](http://creativethink.com/WhackPack/LiveCards/01.html)

I am still organizing and basicaly stiring the cards in their new form.

## My Goal: <br> Collect the musings within the cards for elaboration

I did this manually for a few weeks, then took a peek at the source pages.

I used `curl` on the page url for the whack of the day and gained even more info.

Each page as a coded url is listed on [this page.](all_whacks.md)

> "On a circle, an end point can also be a beginning point." -Heraclitus

> "Every walking animal is driven to its purpose with a whack." -Heraclitus

### Then What?

I will be adding my own "Thwack" to concept and ideas brought to the table.

Putting a yo-yo and programming *spin* on things.

### How did this all happen?

Out shopping at a resale store looking to buy games,

I ended up with the Creative Whack Pack, missing a few cards, in my hand for 88 cents.

I was captivated and soon found [creativethink.com](http://creativethink.com/)
