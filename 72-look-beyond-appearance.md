> “Things love to conceal their true nature.”

Deception is an omnipresent part of life:

Animals __camouflage__ themselves for protection against predators

Predators __disguise__ their intentions in order to trap their prey

In war, military leaders __feign__ weakness to lure an enemy into battle, or fake strength to prevent an enemy attack

In sports, teams __disguise__ one play as another to confuse their opponents

In politics and courtship, politicans and lovers __hide__ character flaws

In riddles, puzzlers __delude__ would-be solvers into making false assumptions

Heraclitus believed that __reality is deceptive.__ He considered it to be an __enigma__. But he felt that one way to understand it is to look beyond our deceptive first impressions, and wonder what else might be going on beneath the surface.

* What seems deceptive in your current situation?
* What other patterns and processes might be at work?
* What is lurking beneath the surface of what you can see?
* In what ways are you deceiving yourself?
