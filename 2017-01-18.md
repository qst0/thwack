#49 Take a whack at it

You can’t hit a home run unless you step up to the plate.

You can’t catch fish unless you put your line in the water.

You can’t make your idea a reality unless you take a whack at it.

If you want to be a singer, go sing. 

Sing in the shower.

Sing for your friends.

Join the choir.

Audition for a musical.

### Start now.

Many of our personal goals are stranded on a little island called the “Someday I’ll.”

Don’t wait for your idea to happen. Make it happen.

As adman Carl Ally put it,

“Either you let your life slip away by not doing the things you want to do, or you get up and do them.”

* What are three things you can do to reach your goal?

* How great is your sense of urgency?

* What can you do in the next five minutes?
