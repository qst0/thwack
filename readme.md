# Thought Thwack

Thought Thwack is inspired by the amazing [Creative and Innovative Whack Packs](http://creativethink.com/).
The stories and creative strategies in the cards are fun and intresting. Please consider buying them!

I want to create my own, based on some of the same insights of heraclitus and other sources.

## My Goal: <br> Collect the musings within the cards for elaboration

["On a circle, an end point can also be a beginning point." -Heraclitus](2016-12-23.md)
["Every walking animal is driven to its purpose with a whack." -Heraclitus](2016-12-24.md)

### Then What?

I will be adding my own "Thwack" to concept and ideas brought to the table.

Putting a yo-yo and programming *spin* on things.

### "How do you teach creative thinking?"

You improve your creative abilities by using them, not by being leactured at.

In my seminars, I run individual and group exercisies some focus on the client's needs, and others out in "Left Field". The participants do the exercise and then discuss the kind of thinking that is exhibited.

Then I give examples from business, technology, history, anture, and a variety of other sources. Finally, we apply the lessons of the exercises to the problem at hand.

In addition, I use various props and video media to make my points. Thus, the sessions are fun.

### "Can you customize a session for my group?"

Sure! It all depends on your specific objectives, the number of participants, and the leght of time fiven to the session. THe result can be a two-day seminar for fifteen people, a half-day workshop to fifty people, or an hour presentation to five thousand people. Here are some exaplmes of different seminar situations in which I've been involved:

* A television network trying to think up new program ideas
* A greeting card company looking for wats to incorporate technology into their products
* A computer company intrested in decreasing the length of time needed to complete software projects
* The exploration division of an oil company wanting to think of alternative ways to interpret seismic data.
* The finance department of a beer company wishing to develop ways to serve its in-house cliets more effectively
* A retail chain wanting to get a glimpse of what the "kitchen of the future" will look like
* A pharmaceutical company exploring the cancer market for new product opportunities

### "What are the objectives of your sessions?"

* Provide participants with new skills to generate, manage and apply ideas.
* Identify places to find good ideas
* Practice the four roles of the creative process: Explorer, Artist, Judge and Warrior
* Open the mental locks that prevent the emergence of new ideas
* Establish methods for fertilizing your work environment so that it fosters innovation
* Give each participant an insight into his own particular creative thinking style
* Put together an "action plan" for each participant to apply the benefits of the session to their work
