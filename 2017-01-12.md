# 11 Use your senses

Think of one of your favorite holidays, perhaps your birthday, Christmas, or the Fourth of July.

Now think of the various smells, sights , tastes, feelings, and sounds related to this day.

Go ahead and take a minute to do it.

Pretty easy, right? A lot of sensory information comes to mind.

Now, do the very same exercise with your concept or issue as the subject.

What are the smells, sights, tastes, and feelings and sounds associated with it?

Use all your senses and pay attention to a wide variety of different information.

If you’re visually oriented, focus also on the “sound” or the “smell” of a situation.

If you’re sound oriented, focus as well on the situation’s “fine visual details.”

If you’re analytically oriented, focus on how something feels.

— What other senses can you use?

— Pick one of your senses, say “hearing.” How would your concept appear if you received NO auditory information at all?

— If your concept were a food, what would it taste like?

— If your problem were music, what genre would it be (jazz, classical, rock, etc.)?
Greek philosopher Heraclitus noted: 
      
      “If all things turned to smoke, the nose would become the discerning organ.”

— What associations do the following spark in your mind that might be useful to your issue:
